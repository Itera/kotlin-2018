# Kotlin 2018 workshop

This is a Maven project which contains simple assignments for playing around with Kotlin code. Feel free to explore it and extend it on your own.

## Prerequisites

1. [Intellij IDEA Community or Ultimate edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
2. [JDK8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html?printOnly=1)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (to clone this repository)

## Order of assignments

It should not matter much in which order you start, but this is the recommended one:

1. `models.kt` - introduction to classes
2. `collections.kt` - introduction to collections
3. `casting.kt` - smart casting
4. `various.kt` - if there's a spare time

## How to work with the assignments

Read the description in comments and try to implement every `TODO()` there is. There's a `main` method in every file, which should run without any errors. In first file, the `models.kt` you need to uncomment the code in main method and make it compile.
